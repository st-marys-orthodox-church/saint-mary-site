## Brand voice

**Tone:** Warm, welcoming, professional. Like a trusted family friend who happens to run a beautiful venue.

The venue is rooted in the Romanian-American community but welcomes everyone. Avoid language that feels exclusive to members of the church. The facility's origin story (built with community sacrifice and dedication, "a gift to future generations") can be used tastefully in about/story sections but should not dominate the booking-oriented copy.

### Do
- Lead with experience: "create unforgettable memories," "your perfect day," "feel right at home"
- Be specific: "up to 300 guests," "$2,000 starting price," "5,000 sq ft"
- Highlight transparency: "fully refundable deposits," "straightforward pricing"
- Short, punchy lines for headlines and CTAs

### Don't
- Vague superlatives: "world-class," "state-of-the-art," "premier," "best"
- Exclusive religious language in booking copy
- Long paragraphs in hero/feature sections — web readers scan
- Unverifiable claims about rankings or awards

## Where copy lives

User-facing strings are translated via `next-i18next`. The source of truth is `public/locales/en/*.json` — organised by page (`home`, `packages`, `gallery`, `contact`) plus shared buckets (`common`, `seo`). Edit those, not inline JSX.

- Venue facts (name, address, phone, etc.) live in `src/utils/AppConfig.ts` first, then may be referenced from locale files.
- Static content collections — features, packages, hero slides, nav items — live in `src/utils/` (`Features.ts`, `Packages.ts`, `HeroSlides.ts`, `Navigation.ts`). These reference i18n keys rather than raw strings.
- After any change to `en/*.json`, run `pnpm i18n:sync` to refresh `es` and `ro`. With `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set the script auto-translates; otherwise new strings appear as `[ES] …` / `[RO] …` until a human translates them.

## Copy length targets

| Element | Target |
|---|---|
| `<title>` tag | < 60 characters |
| Meta description | 140–160 characters |
| Hero headline | 4–8 words |
| Hero subheadline | 1–2 sentences |
| Section headline | 3–7 words |
| CTA button label | 2–4 words |
| Card / feature description | 1–3 sentences |
| Package description | 2–4 sentences |

Social captions can be warmer and more conversational than website copy. Use photos to anchor the caption. Always include location (`#DaculaGA #GwinnettCounty`) and event type hashtags (`#WeddingVenue #EventHall #PartyVenue`).
